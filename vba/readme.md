VBA code_snippets
==================
This repository contains samples of Excel VBA code.

**html_generator.txt** contains scripts from an html-generating Excel spreadsheet.  Photo information was entered in a spreadsheet, including photo name, caption and file location.  The scripts read the file information and created a series of html pages to make up a photo album web page.

**qif_maker.txt** contains scripts from a transaction entry tool tailored to the Quicken personal finance application.  A template was provided into which personal expense information was entered, including date, merchant, expense description, account and expense category.   The tool would then automatically create matching transactions for each entered transaction to simulate a dual-entry book-keeping system.  Using a custom menu item, the user would create a new text file in .qif format containing transaction information for all transactions for uploading into the Quicken program.

**water_modeling.txt** contains functions that encapsulate logic that would have been difficult to implement and error prone and directly on the spreadsheet.  This was part of a water-repricing model for a community water conservation district.
